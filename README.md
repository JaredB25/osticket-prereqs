</p>
<p>
To begin this process, we first create a resource group called osTicket in Microsoft Azure.  Then, inside this resource group, establish a virtual machine.  We will make sure the virtual machine (VM) has at least two virtual CPUs andÂ runs a Windows 10 Pro image.  OsTicket will be installed and utilized in this virtual machine.

</p>
<p>
Next, use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access the virtual machine.  To create the RDP connection, copy the Public IPv4 address for the virtual machine that appears in the Azure site. Enter the lab user credentials that were set up during the virtual machine's setup.
